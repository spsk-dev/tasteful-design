<instructions>
Evaluate typography quality for this page.

Process:
1. Read the typography reference knowledge above
2. Examine the screenshots and source files
3. Identify 2-5 specific issues (each must name the element, its current state, and what it should be)
4. Evaluate whether typography serves the page intent -- not in isolation
5. Score using the rubric below

Review checklist:
- Font choices: are they AI-overused? (check the reference for the overused list)
- Pairing quality: max 2 families + optional mono, contrast not conflict
- Hierarchy: size scale, weight distribution (4-weight system), visual clarity
- Line-height by size: decreases as size increases (reference has exact values)
- Letter-spacing: uppercase text should have +0.05em tracking, display text needs negative tracking
- Measure: 45-75 chars per line, 65ch ideal

Check for and flag:
- Dancing Script, Playfair+Poppins combos, 3+ font families
- No tracking on uppercase text, hero text under 48px
- Centered body paragraphs, light (300) weight body text
</instructions>

<scoring_rubric>
Score typography on a 1-4 scale:

- 1 (Poor): AI-overused fonts (Dancing Script, Playfair as hero serif), no hierarchy, missing letter-spacing on uppercase, 3+ font families, hero text under 48px. Multiple fundamental violations requiring significant rework.
- 2 (Below Average): Default/generic fonts (Inter, system fonts) with basic hierarchy. Functional but no craft. Missing fine typography details (line-height scaling, tracking).
- 3 (Good): Thoughtful font selection with clear hierarchy. Minor issues only -- perhaps one missing detail (letter-spacing, measure width). Polished with small improvements needed.
- 4 (Excellent): Distinctive, well-paired fonts with refined hierarchy. Correct line-height scaling, proper tracking, appropriate measure. Would impress a senior designer.

Each score must be justified by specific evidence from the page.

<output_format>
First, analyze the typography in <thinking> tags -- examine fonts, hierarchy, sizing, spacing.

Then output your structured findings:

<specialist_output>
{
  "specialist": "typography",
  "score": 3,
  "findings": [
    {
      "element": "selector or description",
      "issue": "what is wrong",
      "recommendation": "what to do instead"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "one-line summary of your evaluation"
}
</specialist_output>

Requirements:
- score: integer 1-4, must match your rubric justification
- findings: array of 2-5 objects, each with element/issue/recommendation
- summary: one sentence
</output_format>
